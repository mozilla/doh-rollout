## This repo hosts strings used by the DNS Over HTTPS doorhanger UI shipping in Firefox.

This is a temporary setup until the strings are migrated to conform to standard mozilla-central protocol.


## Former README below for archival purposes

***Note - This repository has been archived as of Tuesday, January 7th, 2020. The DNS-over-HTTPS extension [has been migrated](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-release/source/browser/extensions/doh-rollout) to the Firefox browser as of [Release 72](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/72.0/releasenotes/).

## DoH Rollout

This is a WebExtension + Experimental API to gradually roll out [DNS-over-HTTP](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https) to Firefox users.

## How to install WebExtension

1. Install web-ext `npm install -g web-ext`
2. Install the dependencies `npm install`
3. Build the addon `npm run build`

## How to run WebExtension
1. `web-ext run --verbose -f Nightly`

OR

1. Run a non-release build (Nightly or Aurora) version 61+.
2. Set `extensions.legacy.enabled` to true in about:config
3. Navigate to `about:debugging`, choose
   "Load Temporary Add-on" and select a file from this project:
   - Select `manifest.json`
   - Select `src/web-ext-artifacts/dns_over_https-${VERSION}.zip`

You should see a new entry in the list of extensions titled "DoH Rollout".

To see the banner [create a new boolean pref](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox#w_adding-changing-and-resetting-preferences) `doh-rollout.enabled` in [about:config](about:config) and set to `true`.

This will run heuristics against your network settings to determine if DoH can safely be enabled. If it can, it will trigger a doorhanger notification announcing that is has been enabled.

To check if DoH is turned on, check the value of pref `network.trr.mode`. If it is enabled, it will be set to `2`.

[Telemetry][telemetry-schema-link] will be sent each time heuristics are evaluated.
